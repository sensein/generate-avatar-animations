Animations for body type 5 is currently not supported, as separating 
the arms from the rest of the body via the mask would result in having 
to completely remove the avatar's hands.

The mask is less accurate on thicker outfits as the masks used to separate the arms 
from the rest of the body were created based off of the avatars base clothes.

Hairstyles that extend to the shoulder may result in the mask not separating the head
and body properly.

There seems to be some hairstyles that are wider than the default width of the bounding_box.
The code to generate the animations will need to be updated alongside the mask templates to
account for this.

One piece outfits (such as dresses) separate automatically. This appears to be due to
the automatic merging and not with the mask templates.

Some costumes are too bulky, resulting in the same masking issue occuring on 
body type 5.
